# 365 Puzzle

Sometime ago, I came across this puzzle called the 365 puzzle. I realized that the search space is quite large and thought of using constraint programming to solve it. In [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/XjpBaEULKQs), I describe the puzzle and my solution approach using constraint programming. Here is the complete code for the CP and brute force approach.
